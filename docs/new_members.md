This process is now simpler than ever! Follow the steps below to get started:

1. Fork this repo. Remember to rename it and such!

    <a class="btn" href="https://github.com/Amp-Lab-at-VT/SampleProject/fork" >Sample Project</a>

2. Clone the repo locally, update the readme.md file, and push it to Github. 

3. Include the link to the forked repo in this form:

    <a class="btn" href="https://github.com/Amp-Lab-at-VT/website/issues/new/choose" >Join the Amp Lab: Submit your project for review!</a>

4. Create a brief project proposal composed of:
    - Overview (2-3 slides)
        - Clearly state the goal of the project
        - Use visuals such as block diagrams, flow charts, or system level.
    - Educational value (1 slide)
        - Explain how working on this project will enhance your knowledge, skills, or experience as a student.
    - Component cost (1 slide)
        - List the components required and the individual costs
        - Provide a total cost estimate.
    - Timeline (1 slide)
        - Outline a realistic timeline for the project
    
    Once your proposal is completed, schedule a "Project Proposal" presentation with the AMP team at https://amp-lab.org/soldering/booking. Include your name and github repository in the notes section. The presentation length should be no longer than 10 minutes.

**Too confusing?** We get it, git isn't an easy thing to master. Check <a href = "/beginners_guide">this tutorial</a> to get started without having to clone the repo locally.
